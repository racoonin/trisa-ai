## üöÄ QUICK FIX FOR UI BROKEN ON VERCEL

### PROBLEM: 
Your Vercel deployment works but CSS/JS files aren't loading properly, making the interface look broken.

### ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE SOLUTION (Just Fixed):

I've updated your files to properly serve static assets. Now:

1. **Commit these changes to GitHub**:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix static file serving for Vercel deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Vercel**:
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Find your project
   - Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

3. **The UI should now work perfectly!**

### üéØ WHAT I FIXED:
- ‚úÖ Updated `vercel.json` with explicit routes for CSS, JS, images
- ‚úÖ Added static file build configuration  
- ‚úÖ Enhanced Express server to serve files with proper headers
- ‚úÖ Added explicit routes for `/styles.css`, `/app.js`, `/logo.png`
